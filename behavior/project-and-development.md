# Project and Development

## If your client tells you that the website you built for them is running slow, how do you triage this to understand the root cause?

#### A: There are several reason in different ways could cause the reasons:

### 1\)    Reason cause by the browser:

* First check error with browsers console tools. Make sure there is nothing blocking. And no error occurred.
* Check the data or files is too big to load or not.
* Check JavaScript or Flash plugin is activated or not. \(Recommend use HTML5 media\)

### 2\)    Reason cause by the project:

* Make sure the components are optimized loaded and rendered.
* No repetitive http requests.
* Make sure use CDN to loading statics assets.
* Check third-parts libs or dependencies.

### 3\)    Reason cause by the server-side:

* Use tech such as Redis to solve the High concurrency issues.
* Check the server-side for hosting, balance load, usage or limitation.
* Check cybersecurity. Take basic actions to avoid common cyber attack
* Check database status.

## How do you deal with ambiguous requirements?

To avoid unnecessary requirements. Itâ€™s always a good trial to follow the standards from the documents. 

For some future requirements, we can put them into next version. This is how we stick to the agile development. 

For different ideas about the requirements, we can use the A/B test and let the users decide what is really need. We might get the user data by tracking and doing statics on their behavior and feedbacks.

## What criteria do you take into account when deciding which framework to use to build a project.

* The model of cloud service. SaaS? PaaS? IaaS?
* The scale of the project. The usage of the application. Devices that covered.
* Standard of highly reusable components.
* Does it help to improve the performance, efficiency, and less redundant code?
* Separate the front-end and back-end gracefully
* Solve the intense coupling problem
* Back-end language
* Agile Development or not. \(Future supports or future demands\)
* How many developer we have? The budgets? And due day?
