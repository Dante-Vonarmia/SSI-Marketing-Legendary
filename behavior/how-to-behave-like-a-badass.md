# How to behave like a badass

## Selling yourself

Make people know why you're important or necessary \(show your accomplish\)

## Don't rambling

Straight to the point \(what specific you can do\)

## Answer Experience rather than Concept

When answer specific question. Make sure you always stick to how did you implement the concept with the experience. Not just explain the concept of it. They DON'T care.

## Being genuine

Describe a problem but shows how you benefit or learned from it \(take negative thing into positive\)
