## What is Cross-Origin Resource Sharing \(CORS\)? And how does it works?

CORS is a **security mechanism** that allows a web page from one domain or Origin to access a resource with a different domain \(**cross-domain request\).**

Without features like CORS, websites are **restricted** to accessing resources from the same origin through what is known as **same-origin policy.**

There are often cases where you need to make AJAX \(i.e., Axios\) calls to `https://api.mydomain.com` or `https://mydomain` incorporates your Node.js server or some 3rd party fonts or analytics providers like Google Analytics. **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing \(CORS\)** enables these cross-domain requests**.**

> Allow Cross domain request, bypassing same-origin policy

## What is **same-origin policy?** <a id="9e0a"></a>

The **same-origin policy** is a critical security mechanism that restricts how a document or script loaded from one origin can interact with a resource from another origin

It helps isolate potentially **malicious** document, reducing possible attack vectors such as **CSRF attack**

> same-origin policy is security model for web application

## What is the definition of ‚Äòorigin‚Äô? <a id="8148"></a>

At this point, Someone might wonder the definition of **origin** ü§î

**Origin** includes the combination of protocol, domain, and port. In other words,

The following URLs are different origins

```text
https://www.google.com vs. https://www.api.google.comhttp://localhost:9000 vs. http://localhost:8080
```

While the following URLs are same origins

```text
http://www.example.com/dir/page.html 
vs. 
http://www.example.com/dir/page2.html
```

## How CORS works <a id="85b4"></a>

There are 2 types of CORS requests

1. simple requests
2. preflighted requests

### **1.Simple requests**

CORS request that does not require a preflight request

**Step 1**

A browser tab open to `https://www.mydomain.com` initiates AJAX request `GET` to `https://api.domains.com/widgets`

**Step 2**

Along with adding headers like `Host` , the browser automatically adds the `Origin` Request Header for cross-origin requests

**Step 3**

The server checks the `Origin` request header. If the Origin value is allowed, it sets the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to the value in the request header `Origin`

**Step 4**

When the browser receives the response, the browser checks the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to see if it matches the origin of the tab

If not, the response is blocked

```text
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * allows all origins
--> a large security risk
```

### **2. Preflighted requests**

A preflighted request is a CORS request where the browser is required to send a **preflight** request before sending the request being **preflighted to ask the server permission if the original CORS request can proceed**

**Any CORS request has to be preflighted if**

* **AJAX call to POST JSON data to a REST API meaning the `Content-Type` header is `application/json` ‚Üí RESTful API request**
* AJAX call to an API which uses a token to authenticate the API in a request header such `Authorization` ‚Üí **authorized request using token**

**Step 1**

The browser sends the `OPTIONS` request first \(aka the preflight request\)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-07-19-at-6.43.33-pm.png)

**Step 2**

The server respond back specifying the allowed HTTP methods and headers. If the original CORS request intended to send a header or HTTP method not in the list, **failed**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-07-19-at-6.44.11-pm.png)

**Step 3**

Since the **headers and method** pass the check `200 OK` , the browser sends the original CORS request \( `Origin` header in the request\)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-07-19-at-6.45.01-pm.png)

**Step 4**

The response has the correct origin in `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header so checks pass and control is handed back to the browser tab

## Give some samples of Browser Object Model \(BOM\).

## Explain RESTful API. What's the main features and why they're important?

REST is stands for REpresentational State Transfer;   
it's all about communication of state, and structured in terms of the resources which achieve this.

Good REST APIs are good software;   
they are simultaneously good consumer products, with the understanding that their consumers are application programmers.

Good APIs know their version  
providing the version as a parameter**,** specifying it in the header.

Good REST APIs:

* Result paginate, filtering, sorting & searching
* are well-documented and reliable
* use HTTP verbs as Fielding originally defined
* support X-HTTP-METHOD-Override to accommodate picky proxies
* express URLs with nouns rather than verbs
* track version
* make expressive use of HTTP Status Codes
* handle errors carefully and explicitly
* log activity
* choose wisely between XML \(increasingly rare\), JSON, and HATEOAS \(rapidly growing\)
* Limiting which fields are returned by the API
* explicitly design in other commercially-significant API-specific features

## Explain Event target, Event Bubbling and Event Capturing ?

The standard [DOM Events](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/) describes 3 phases of event propagation:

1. Capturing phase ‚Äì the event goes down to the element.
2. Target phase ‚Äì the event reached the target element.
3. Bubbling phase ‚Äì the event bubbles up from the element.

### Event Bubbling

The process is called ‚Äúbubbling‚Äù, because events ‚Äúbubble‚Äù from the inner element up through parents like a bubble in the water.

When an event happens on an element, it first runs the handlers on it, then on its parent, then all the way up on other ancestors.

### Event Capturing

There‚Äôs another phase of event processing called ‚Äúcapturing‚Äù. It is rarely used in real code, but sometimes can be useful.

**Before we only talked about bubbling, because the capturing phase is rarely used. Normally it is invisible to us.**

To catch an event on the capturing phase, we need to set the handler `capture` option to `true`:

```javascript
elem.addEventListener(..., {capture: true})
// or, just "true" is an alias to {capture: true}
elem.addEventListener(..., true)
```

There are two possible values of the `capture` option:

* If it‚Äôs `false` \(default\), then the handler is set on the bubbling phase.
* If it‚Äôs `true`, then the handler is set on the capturing phase.

#### Example of Bubbling and Capturing

```javascript
for(let elem of document.querySelectorAll('*')) {
  elem.addEventListener("click", e => alert(`Capturing: ${elem.tagName}`), true);
  elem.addEventListener("click", e => alert(`Bubbling: ${elem.tagName}`));
}
```

### Event target

A handler on a parent element can always get the details about where it actually happened.

**The most deeply nested element that caused the event is called a** _**target**_ **element, accessible as `event.target`.**

Note the differences from `this` \(=`event.currentTarget`\):

* `event.target` ‚Äì is the ‚Äútarget‚Äù element that initiated the event, it doesn‚Äôt change through the bubbling process.
* `this` ‚Äì is the ‚Äúcurrent‚Äù element, the one that has a currently running handler on it.

For instance, if we have a single handler `form.onclick`, then it can ‚Äúcatch‚Äù all clicks inside the form. No matter where the click happened, it bubbles up to `<form>` and runs the handler.

In `form.onclick` handler:

* `this` \(=`event.currentTarget`\) is the `<form>` element, because the handler runs on it.
* `event.target` is the actual element inside the form that was clicked.
