# CSS3 New features

## What are new features in CSS3?

## Is there any reason you'd want to use `translate()` instead of `absolute` positioning, or vice-versa? And why?

`translate()` is a value of CSS `transform`. Changing `transform` or `opacity` does not trigger browser reflow or repaint but does trigger compositions; whereas changing the absolute positioning triggers `reflow`. `transform` causes the browser to create a GPU layer for the element but changing absolute positioning properties uses the CPU. Hence `translate()` is more efficient and will result in shorter paint times for smoother animations.

When using `translate()`, the element still occupies its original space \(sort of like `position: relative`\), unlike in changing the absolute positioning.
