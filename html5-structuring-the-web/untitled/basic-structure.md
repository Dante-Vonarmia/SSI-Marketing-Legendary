# Basic structure

## What is HTML Stand for?

**HTML** \(HyperText Markup Language\) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. 

## What does a doctype do?

In HTML, the doctype is the required "`<!DOCTYPE html>`" preamble found at the top of all documents. 

Its sole purpose is to prevent a browser from switching into so-called “quirks mode” when rendering a document.

The "`<!DOCTYPE html>`" doctype ensures that the browser makes a best-effort attempt at following the relevant specifications, rather than using a different rendering mode that is incompatible with some specifications.

## What is the difference between HTML elements and tags?

![The anatomy of the element](../../.gitbook/assets/image.png)

The [element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started#Anatomy_of_an_HTML_element) is the **opening tag**, followed by **content**, followed by the **closing tag**.

![Elements can also have attributes](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%282%29.png)

[Attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started#Attributes) contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content. In this example, the **`class`** attribute is an identifying name used to target the element with style information.

An attribute should have:

* A space between it and the element name. \(For an element with more than one attribute, the attributes should be separated by spaces too.\)
* The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.
* An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.

## What are self-closing tags / void tags / empty elements / singleton tags?

## What is the difference between attributions and properties?

## What’s the difference between a block-level element and an inline element?

## How is an HTML document structured? \(hint: What is DOCTYPE tag; HTML tag; Head tag; Body tag\)

## Why is it generally a good idea to position CSS `<link>`s between `<head></head>` and JS `<script>`s just before `</body>`? Do you know any exceptions?

## What you can do with a `<meta>` tag?

1. `<meta charset="utf-8">`: This element specifies the character set for your document to UTF-8, which includes most characters from the vast majority of human written languages. With this setting, the page can now handle any textual content it might contain. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some problems later.
