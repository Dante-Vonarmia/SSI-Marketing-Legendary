## What is Dead Links and what does they do?

If you have a website, I'm sure you’ve put a lot of hard work and long hours into making it a valuable resource for your visitors. But if your links aren't working, it can derail all of your hard work. Broken links on your website can be harmful in two ways:

* **They make for a bad user experience** – When users click on links and reach dead-end 404 errors, they get frustrated and may never return.
* **They devalue your SEO efforts** – Broken links restrict the flow of link equity throughout your site, which impacts rankings negatively.

## How do you create text on a webpage that will allow you to send an email when clicked?

```markup
<a href="mailto:your@email.address">Email Me</a>
```

## How to access external links and linking to non-HTML resources?

Links that open in a new tab/window via `target="_blank"`, or links that point to a download file should indicate what will happen when the link is followed.

Basically, we'd like to open a new tab or window while we **access external links** or l**ink to a non-HTML resource.** Such as download.

People experiencing low vision conditions, navigating with the aid of screen reading technology, or with cognitive concerns may be confused when a new tab, window, or application opens unexpectedly. Older screen-reading software may not even announce the behavior.
