# Performance and integration

## [Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Using_web_workers)

Allows delegation of JavaScript evaluation to background threads, allowing these activities to prevent slowing down interactive events.

### [`XMLHttpRequest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/XMLHttpRequest) level 2

Allows fetching asynchronously some parts of the page, allowing it to display dynamic content, varying according to the time and user actions. This is the technology behind [Ajax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/AJAX).

## JIT-compiling JavaScript engines

The new generation of JavaScript engines is much more powerful, leading to greater performance.

## [History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history)

Allows the manipulation of the browser history. This is especially useful for pages loading interactively new information.

## [The contentEditable Attribute: Transform your website to a wiki!](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Content_Editable)

HTML5 has standardized the contentEditable attribute. Learn more about this feature.

## [Drag and drop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DragDrop/Drag_and_Drop)

The HTML5 drag and drop API allows support for dragging and dropping items within and between web sites. This also provides a simpler API for use by extensions and Mozilla-based applications.

## [Focus management in HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Focus_management_in_HTML)

The new HTML5 `activeElement` and `hasFocus` attributes are supported.

## [Web-based protocol handlers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web-based_protocol_handlers)

You can now register web applications as protocol handlers using the `navigator.registerProtocolHandler()` method.

## [requestAnimationFrame](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/requestAnimationFrame)

Allows control of animations rendering to obtain optimal performance.

## [Fullscreen API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Using_full-screen_mode)

Controls the usage of the whole screen for a Web page or application, without the browser UI displayed.

## [Pointer Lock API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/API/Pointer_Lock_API)

Allows locking the pointer to the content, so games and similar applications don't lose focus when the pointer reaches the window limit.

## [Online and offline events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Online_and_offline_events)

In order to build a good offline-capable web application, you need to know when your application is actually offline. Incidentally, you also need to know when your application has returned to an online status again.
