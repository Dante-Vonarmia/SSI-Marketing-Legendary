## Be a Programmer - Principle

Let's not rush to diving in some "code".   
There are some inevitable rules that I have been followed for many years, and I hope that you could remember these rules because they are extremely beneficial.

### **Will the Cycle, be unbroken**

Whenever you lost in the ocean of the programming, these questions could always be your lighthouse to guide your way.

_‌So, what is coding anyway?  \(The essence\)_

_What do we use coding for? \(The aim\)_

_Where do we get started? \(The solution\)_

_How coding affect us? \(The Causality\)_

_How do we manage them? \(The_ maintenance_\)_

_Why we use it? Can we improve it? \(The future\)_

### Tools & Habits

> Coding is just like a tool. It's not any kind of theory.

> Do NOT from dread to coding, to discard coding.

> Utilize the tools. Don't just read them.

## **Build your Own Skill Set**

### **Road-map**

A well planned learning path is essential for a systematic study.  
It helps to get the specific title step by step without deviation.

### **Work Flow - Agile Development**

#### Collect requirements / **Task’s Management**

#### Brain storm & **Notification & Communication**

[Slack](https://slack.com) is one of the most efficient, famous and authorized chatting tool in occupation environment. Any further discussion would be only access through it.

An outstanding staff is never about how flawless himself/herself. It’s about the team work. It’s about letting people know what’s your progress that you’re working on and how do they cooperate with you. This is why we use tasks management such as Notion or Jira.

#### Design prototype **/** Prototype Tool

#### Mock demonstration

#### Web designing

#### Project foundation setup

#### TDD + Coding + BDD / Coding Environment

#### Testing Tool / Pressure Testing, A/B Testing, Compatibility Testing....

#### Review code + Integrate all modular

#### Build & Release / Publish and Version release

#### Feedback and Improvement

## Standards

### Behavior and Performance

> TAKING notes seriously!

> No AWOL \(Absent without official leaving\)

> Good Tools, Good Habits, Good Mood, & Practice a lot.

> Practice is the only shortcut.

## Start Interview Questions

In our interview question, we cover: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, and common Behavior questions. You don't have to go through all of them but remember whenever you feel like to do some self-test. This is exactly the right place for you. And it is always encouraged to contribute your own questions to us.

Lets' build an empire together!
