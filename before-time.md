## Be a Programmer - Principle

Let's not rush to diving in some "code".   
There are some inevitable rules that I have been followed for many years, and I hope that you could remember these rules because they are extremely beneficial.

### **Will the Cycle, be unbroken**

Whenever you lost in the ocean of the programming, these questions could always be your lighthouse to guide your way.

_‌So, what is coding anyway?  \(The essence\)_

_What do we use coding for? \(The aim\)_

_Where do we get started? \(The solution\)_

_How coding affect us? \(The Causality\)_

_How do we manage them? \(The_ maintenance_\)_

_Why we use it? Can we improve it? \(The future\)_

### Tools & Habits

> Coding is just like a tool. It's not any kind of theory.

> Do NOT from dread to coding, to discard coding.

> Utilize the tools. Don't just read them.

## **Build your Own Skill Set**

### **Road-map**

A well planned learning path is essential for a systematic study.  
It helps to get the specific title step by step without deviation.  
[\(see here\)](https://roadmap.sh)

### **Work Flow - Agile Development**

#### Collect requirements / Brainstorm

* You don’t need to know everything, nor all the existing frameworks. The most significant thing is to have a good base. Know the language in depth before starting with a Framework and learn fundamental things like the [**SOLID** ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)principles or how to write clean code.

#### **Notification /** **Task’s Management**

#### **Communication**



#### Design prototype **/** Prototype Tool

* [**YAGNI** principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it): don’t codify more than you’ve been asked to. Don’t anticipate the future, and just create something that works as soon as possible. Code only the necessary parts to solve the current problem.
* [**KISS**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle): “Keep it simple, stupid” or “keep it stupid simple” is a design principle that states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated. And while this is logical, it is sometimes difficult to achieve.

#### Mock demonstration

* It is good to discuss and try some thing new here. Never try to change anything directly on codes.

#### Project foundation setup

#### TDD + Coding + BDD / Coding Environment

* Take the code and break down big pieces of code into small functions.



#### Testing Tool / Pressure Testing, A/B Testing, Compatibility Testing....

#### Review code + Integrate all modular

#### Build & Release / Publish and Version release

#### Feedback and Improvement

## Standards

### Behavior and Performance

> TAKING notes seriously!

> No AWOL \(Absent without official leaving\)

> Good Tools, Good Habits, Good Mood, & Practice a lot.

> Practice is the only shortcut.

> Expose Your Ignorance Daily

## Start Interview Questions

In our interview question, we cover: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, and common Behavior questions. You don't have to go through all of them but remember whenever you feel like to do some self-test. This is exactly the right place for you. And it is always encouraged to contribute your own questions to us.

Lets' build an empire together!
